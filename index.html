                <h2>Falling in Love with Type</h2>
                <p>An essay for students just beginning their relationship with typography</p>

            <p>As a graphic design student at the end of the 20th century I hated typography. I didn’t just dislike it. I hated it. I remember being assigned Robert Bringhurst’s book, The Elements of Typographic Style. It bored me to tears. No, it bored me to sleep—every time I picked it up. I remember thinking that I majored in graphic design to exercise my artistic skills, not to typeset someone else’s. Software, technical skills, and keeping up with visual trends were far more appealing and engaging to me at that point in my limited experience with design. Besides, wasn’t typography a skill that accompanied the printing press, an antiquated skill of the 1500s? I wanted to work with emerging technology, which, at the time, was the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>When I graduated with my BFA in graphic design I took a break from design and pursued an MFA in computer art. It was during this time that I dove head first into code: html, css, js, max/msp, java, actionscript, lingo, etc. I studied usability and human computer interaction. I fell in love with textiles. I no longer identified myself as a designer. I was experimental. I made fine art. During this time typography was very far from my mind.</p>
            <p>My first teaching position out of graduate school was in a graphic design program, even though I didn’t classify myself as a designer. It was during this time that I was asked to develop a course on visual design for non-majors. In considering the audience, and what they hoped to get out of such a course, I made the radical decision to teach design principles using software my students were familiar with: Microsoft Word and Microsoft Powerpoint. Demonstrations focused on customizing the experience of presentations and text documents and emphasizing topics like organization and hierarchy. This experience taught me that (1) I approach problems, like  developing this course, like a designer and (2) typography and typesetting are fundamental to visual design.</p>
            <p>The following year I taught in a small liberal arts college in New York City in a communication studies program. The students I worked with often did not have an art or design background, but desperately needed those skills to meet their very ambitious career goals. Résumés needed to be skimmable; personal websites needed to be organized and readable; client interactions needed to be professional.From my perspective,  typography went from peripheral to a life skill. Complementing this revelation, web typography began to blossom with the implementation of @font-face in CSS. Important web design trade publications I regularly read started talking about typography. Typography became relevant.</p>
            <p>After a few years of teaching and doing freelance web design work professionally, I finally felt like a designer and not an imposter. I went to design conferences. I read every book on web typography that was published. I learned about the physiology of reading. I discovered the impact typography has on experience (despite being told a number of times before). Once I made the connection to user experience (UX), I became addicted to learning about type. At this point, I’m not sure if I’m an addict or in love. I’ve reread The Elements of Typographic Style with new eyes. I can’t say that I am a fan of Bringhurst’s long-winded writing style, but I am a fan of what he has to say. Excerpts like this one, “The typographer's one essential task is to interpret and communicate the text. Its tone, its tempo, its logical structure, its physical size, all determine the possibilities of its typographic form. The typographer is to the text as the theatrical director to the script, or the musician to the score.” provide memorable insights into the power of typography. Richard Rutter has attempted to update Bringhurst’s text and broaden its audience by <a href="http://webtypography.net/">applying its concepts to the web</a>. Maybe my journey would have been different had this version been available to me at the start of the career.</p>
            <p>There is no golden ticket to fluency in typesetting and typography. Such skills require nurturing, time and patience. Over time I hope that your curiosity will lead you to your own type love story.</p>
